# Memory Game

Welcome to the Memory Game repository! This is a classic memory game implementation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective of the game is to find matching pairs of cards by flipping them over one by one.


## Features

- A grid of cards that are randomly shuffled at the beginning of the game.
- Cards can be flipped over to reveal their hidden symbols.
- The player can only flip two cards at a time.
- If the two flipped cards match, they disappear.
- If the two flipped cards do not match, they are flipped back after an alert.
- A congratulations alert pops up with game score is displayed when all cards are matched.
- Page reloads once all the cards match.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
